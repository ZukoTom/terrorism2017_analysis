# terrorism2017_analysis
draft analysis of 2017 terrorrism data as collected in GTD project (may be subject to future changes)
We analyze world terrorism data of 2017 based on data made available by the University of Maryland at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ . 
We preprocess the data in Python and attempt to analyze it in R language. 
We conclude that groups of different terrorism attacks can be distinguished
and some variables might be linked together or variable modalities with other variable modalities although we find little in our conclusion. 
We'd like to thank our professors at CNAM and @Eniidras for his helps on a crucial while loop in the python script
